# Setting up Slack Bot
## The Slack bot needs write permissions in the channels or groups where it is allowed to post messages.

To grant permissions to the bot, follow these steps:

    1- Access the Slack website.
    2- Go to the "Apps" section.
    3- Select the bot application that has been created.
    4- In the "Settings" section, select "Permission Management" (chat:write, chat:write.public).
    5- In this section, you can configure the different permissions you want to grant to the bot.
    6- To post messages in private channels or groups, the bot needs to be invited first to those channels or groups.
